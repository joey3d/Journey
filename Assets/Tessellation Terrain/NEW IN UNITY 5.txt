PBS being part of all shaders in Unity 5 caused some drastic changes to
how the Tessellated Terrain package works.
Using the alpha channel of the diffuse texture for the displacement bump map is not an option anymore,
since that makes it impossible for the shader to use smoothness or metallic maps.
The Unity 5 version of this package supports both.

This is achieved through some extra shader code and an editor tool.
This tool is called "Tessellation Terrain Texture Wizard".
It creates special textures that have all three maps (displacement (bump), smoothness, metallic) combined
in their alpha channel, each taking a quarter of the available space.
The shaders use the appropriate parts of the texture for further calculations.

To use the wizard, right click into your assets (or click on "Assets" at thetop of the editor)
and choose "Tessellation Terrain Texture Wizard".
Assign a diffuse texture (the color map) and every other map you want as a grayscale texture.
You'll find examples for appropriate textures in the demo folder.
If you leave a field blank, the map is confidered black -
which means zero displacement, smoothness or metallic...ness.

Click the button to let the wizard create the texture.
It will be saved to the same folder the given diffuse texture is in,
with .TTT appended to the diffuse texture's filename.

Use this texture in the "Splat" field of your terrain tool component.
Add a normal map as usual if needed.

If you recreate the texture using the wizard, it will be overriden,
which means that the terrain will forget it. You have to reassign it after updating it.
