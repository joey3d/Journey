Terrain Tessellation Shaders © Sascha Graeff

This document is provided for further understanding why blending doesn't work in some cases when using more than four textures.
See "USING MORE THAN 4 TEXTURES" in the README.txt.


THE ADDPASS PROBLEM

Unity can handle exactly four textures on a terrain. To enable you to use more textures,
it uses a so-called "AddPass" shader to draw the complete terrain again with the next four textures,
and blends the result on the previous result.
The respective four textures of each pass are not accessible for the other passes.
This poses a problem since, with this shader, textures are used to change the geometry of the terrain.
The results of changing the geometry cannot be passed to another pass.
This is why - long story short - it is impossible to blend textures from different passes without creating
displacement related graphical issues, like transparent terrain or dark borders around textures.
